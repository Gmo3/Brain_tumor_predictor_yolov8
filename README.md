# Brain Tumor Classification Through YOLOv8  

YOLOv8 was used as the base of our fine-tuned model for brain tumor classification. This model uses a CNN-based architecture and does best for use cases such as object detection and classification. The model leverages advanced machine learning techniques, including a cyclic learning rate schedule, and applies image preprocessing to improve classification accuracy.
